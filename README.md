### What does this project good for


Imagine you work in your script console of choice. You have acquired some object from e.g. your monitoring system, which contains series of data you want to visualize. This solution allows you to use a webservice where you post your data to and provide a JSONPath to values of your interest. The webservice immediately returns you a link to your visualized data.
